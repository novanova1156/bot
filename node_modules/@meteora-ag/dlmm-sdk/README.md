## Example Usage

For now, see `src/example.ts` for examples. Will add examples once stable.

## Available functions

|Function|Description|Notes|
|---|---|--|
|`getLbPairs`|Get all available LB Pairs||
|`getLbPair`|Get a specific LB Pair||
|`findLbPairs`|Given a X and Y token mint, find corresponding LB Pair(s). Will also find inverse LB Pairs ie desiredTokenX as tokenY and desiredTokenY as tokenX||
|`getBinsAroundActiveBin`|Get current distribution based on a radius around the active bin. Returns price, bin id, x amount and y amount for each bin||
|`getBinsBetweenMinAndMaxPrice`|Get bins and corresponding distribution based on a min and max price. Returns price, bin id, x amount and y amount for each bin||
|`getBinsBetweenLowerAndUpperBound`|Get bins and corresponding distribution based on a min and max bin ID. Returns price, bin id, x amount and y amount for each bin||
|`getCurrentPrice`|Get current price for a LB pair||
|`getPriceOfBinByLbPair`|Get price of a bin by its bin id for a LB pair|Prefer `getPriceOfBinByBinStep` if already have information on bin step to reduce RPC calls|
|`getPriceOfBinByBinStep`|Get price of a bin by its bin id given a bin step|Use this when necessary but in general `getBinsAroundActiveBin`, `getBinsBetweenMinAndMaxPrice` and `getBinsBetweenLowerAndUpperBound` would already return the prices for each bin|
|`getBinIdFromPrice`|Returns the bin id given a price||
|`getPositionsByUser`|Get positions by user pubkey||
|`getPositionsByUserAndLbPair`|Get positions by user pubkey for a specific LB Pair||
|`getPosition`|Get detailed information for a specific position. information includes `binId`, `price`, `positionXAmount`, `positionYAmount` etc+||
|`getEqualWeightageAmount`|Returns an equal weightage amount of the opposing token based on ratio|This is useful when adding liquidity|
|`initializePositionAndAddLiquidity`|Returns a yet-to-be sent Transaction as well as position and positionMint. Use this to construct a transaction to add liquidity to a LB Pair|Note that X and Y distribution values are a percentage (in BPS) of totalX and totalY amount to be deposited. PositionMint will be remove in next iteration.|
|`removeLiquidity`|withdraw liquidity from a position||
|`createLbPair`|Create a new LB Pair or pool||
|`swap`|Works for swaps from X to Y or Y to X. Todo: Handle situation if bin array not yet initialized|If out token account does not exist, will create out token ATA. If out token is SOL, will receive WSOL. Does not handle for WSOL -> SOL|
